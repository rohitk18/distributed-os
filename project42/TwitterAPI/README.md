##  About the Project:
    This is a Twitter Api Websocket built using the Suave. We have a server which is the main server which communicates with database. It consists of all data of tweets, retweets, hashtags and mentions. The server acts as an engine helpful to distribute tweets. The Web socket interface is used for the registering the account, creating tweets along with hashtags and mentions. Each web socket interface has an akka actor node which is the medium to communicate with the server. These nodes will handle all the communication from the socket. The client testing is done via a browser interface.
