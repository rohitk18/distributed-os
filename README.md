The world has evolved to a new age where there has been an explosion of information. Computers are getting faster, algorithms are getting smarter and internet as communication is becoming more integrated which are enabling us to build a better future. But even a single computer as an individual unit doesn't have enough processing power to combat this huge amount of information. But with the existing resources, a large number of small, interconnected computing units has enough processing power to tackle this everday overload of information. In order to make these computing systems to run effectively, a solution of scalable, distributed, low-cost, reliable system is needed and that's where distributed operating systems come to picture. Technologies widely heard like big data, cloud are the products of this distributed systems. Distributed Systems provide the glue that holds everything together under mildly or harshly adversarial conditions. This course is focused on tackling the challenges that arise in a principled manner.

## Course Outline

1. Actor model and Akka/F#
2. Definition, goals and examples of Distributed Systems
3. System architectures and models
4. Inter process communication
5. Remote invocation, indirect communication
6. Operating system support
7. Distributed objects, web services and peer to peer systems
8. Distributed file systems
9. Time and global states
10. Coordination and agreement
11. Transaction and concurreny control
12. Distributed transactions
13. Replication
14. Distributed multimedia systems 
15. Security, access control

## Projects Implementation
This folder consists of four distributed system projects that I designed as part of my Distributed Operating System Principles here at the University of Florida. 
1. [Finding perfect sqaures which are also sum of consecutive squares](project1/proj1)
2. [Gossip Simulator](project2/project2)
3. [Pastry protocol](project3/project3)
4. [Twitter API - Engine and Simulator](project41)
5. [Twitter API - Client/Server](project42/TwitterAPI)

All projects make use of actor model using Akka and F#.
